# CIS400FinalProject
CIS400 Social Media and Data Mining FinalProject


# Setup
To setup the project you first need to run the requirements.txt file to install all of the
dependencies for the project. This file will be done soon. I have not gotten to it yet

Also what needs to be done is to either put your twitter api keys into the helperFuncs.py file,
or you need to create a config.py file and copy in the text from below and put your keys in there.
The config file is hidden in the .gitignore so no twitter api keys will be made public.


### config.py file outline
apiKey = 'KEY HERE'

apiSecret = 'KEY HERE'

oauthKey = 'KEY HERE'

oauthSecret = 'KEY HERE'
